OK, this is a big change for me.

Originally, this was hosted on my own ftp server, now
long gone. After that, the codebase languished for years.

Now someone requested a script which could track
attendence, so, I resurrected this ancient piece
of work and updated it a bit.

The code is hideous, but it does the job.

It still needs caboodles (that's a technical term, right? ;) )
of work, to make work well and be secure.

It uses a Mysql database, and an external library
to work properly, the library is PhpWord.
Another library which I have begun using is fpdf to
generate pdf format reports, however this is
not essential as the pdf reporting section is
just beginning.

I'll expand this document as I have time.
